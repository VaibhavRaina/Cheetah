# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the contact-sales form (and potentially other forms) by replacing the basic phone input with an international phone number input component. Users will be able to select their country from a dropdown, which will automatically populate the country code prefix, and then enter their phone number. This improves user experience and ensures better phone number validation and formatting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user filling out the contact-sales form, I want to select my country and have the phone number field automatically show the correct country code, so that I can easily enter my phone number in the correct international format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the contact-sales form THEN the system SHALL display a phone input field with a country selector dropdown
2. WHEN the user clicks on the country selector THEN the system SHALL display a searchable list of countries with their flags and names
3. WHEN the user selects a country THEN the system SHALL automatically populate the country code prefix (e.g., +1, +44, +91) in the phone input field
4. WHEN the user types in the phone input field THEN the system SHALL only allow the user to enter the local phone number portion (without the country code)
5. WHEN the user submits the form THEN the system SHALL combine the country code and local number into a complete international phone number format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to search for my country in the dropdown, so that I can quickly find and select it from a long list of countries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the country dropdown THEN the system SHALL display a search input field at the top
2. WHEN the user types in the search field THEN the system SHALL filter countries by name in real-time
3. WHEN the user types a country code (e.g., "US", "UK") THEN the system SHALL also match countries by their ISO codes
4. WHEN no countries match the search THEN the system SHALL display a "No countries found" message
5. WHEN the user clears the search THEN the system SHALL show all countries again

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see country flags next to country names in the dropdown, so that I can visually identify my country more easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the country dropdown THEN the system SHALL display each country with its flag icon and full name
2. WHEN a country is selected THEN the system SHALL show the selected country's flag next to the country code in the input field
3. WHEN the system displays the country list THEN the system SHALL show countries in alphabetical order by name
4. IF a country flag cannot be loaded THEN the system SHALL display a placeholder or the country's ISO code

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the phone number to be properly validated based on the selected country, so that I receive appropriate feedback if my number format is incorrect.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters a phone number THEN the system SHALL validate the number format according to the selected country's phone number patterns
2. WHEN the phone number format is invalid THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message indicating the expected format
3. WHEN the phone number format is valid THEN the system SHALL remove any error messages and allow form submission
4. WHEN the user changes the country THEN the system SHALL re-validate the existing phone number against the new country's format
5. WHEN the form is submitted with an invalid phone number THEN the system SHALL prevent submission and highlight the phone field error

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the phone input component to remember my country selection, so that I don't have to select it again if I return to the form.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a country THEN the system SHALL store the selection in local storage
2. WHEN the user returns to the form THEN the system SHALL pre-select the previously chosen country
3. WHEN the user has not previously selected a country THEN the system SHALL attempt to detect the user's country based on their locale/timezone
4. IF country detection fails THEN the system SHALL default to a common country (e.g., United States)
5. WHEN the user clears their browser data THEN the system SHALL fall back to the default country detection behavior
