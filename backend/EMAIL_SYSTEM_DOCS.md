## Troubleshooting

### If Users Aren't Receiving Emails

#### 1. Check Spam/Junk Folder
Most common issue - emails often end up in spam folder due to:
- New sending domain
- Automated email patterns
- User's email provider settings

**Solution**: Ask users to check spam folder and whitelist `noreply@cheetahai.co`

#### 2. Verify Email Address
- Ensure user registered with correct email address
- Check for typos in email field
- Verify email is active and receiving other emails

#### 3. Email Provider Blocks
Some email providers (especially corporate) block automated emails:
- Gmail: Usually works well
- Outlook/Hotmail: May delay or block
- Corporate emails: Often have strict filtering

#### 4. Brevo Account Status
Check Brevo dashboard for:
- API key validity
- Account status
- Daily/monthly sending limits
- Delivery statistics

#### 5. Server Logs
Check backend logs for:
```bash
# Success logs
Premium purchase email sent successfully: [message-id]

# Error logs
Failed to send premium purchase email: [error-details]
Error sending premium purchase email: [error-details]
```

#### 6. DNS/Domain Issues
Verify sending domain configuration:
- SPF records
- DKIM authentication
- Domain reputation

### Testing Email System

#### Manual Test Script
Run the test script to verify email functionality:
```bash
cd backend
node test-subscription-email.js
```

#### Expected Results
- All 4 email types should return success status
- Each email should get a unique message ID
- No error messages in console

#### Test Email Addresses
Use these for testing:
- `test@example.com` (for testing only)
- Your personal email (for real delivery testing)

### Common Error Messages

#### "BREVO_API_KEY is not set"
- Check `.env` file exists
- Verify API key is correctly set
- Restart server after changing environment variables

#### "Failed to send email: Invalid API key"
- API key expired or incorrect
- Check Brevo account status
- Generate new API key if needed

#### "Network error"
